# Godot Objectifier (GOB)
Finally, a solution to (legally) decompiling a Godot game and realising all of the .obj files have been turned into .mesh files!

This is a very very very alpha build of a program that will get updated whenever I damn well feel like it so just be happy you can process multiple files at once.
